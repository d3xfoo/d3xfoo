### About me

I write TypeScript and love building performant, reliable and optimized software that solves actual problems.

Good workflow saves time. Bad workflow destroys souls.

**Setup:** VIM • Ghostty • Tmux • i3 • zsh

**Facts:**

- Deep into keyboard keybindings (probably weird ones)
- 6 cats
- Workflow optimization addict
- Tinker with hardware and SBCs
- Run home servers because why not

That's it.
